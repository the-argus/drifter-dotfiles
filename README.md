# DISCLAIMER
- my rofi is modified dracula
- my vscode theme was originally nur's Just Black, heavily modified
The GTK theme "Black-n-White" is made by user CRAZYT on gnome-look.org.  find the theme at https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1013445/. It's only included here for simplicity's sake. I am assuming the author doesn't get ad revenue or anything from that site, so I'm just including it in my dotfiles.
